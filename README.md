# k8s_unwritten_rules
This is my list of unwritten rules reagarding k8s

1. Kubernetes is an API
2. Label everything under the sun
3. You learn stuff by **tab** **tab**
4. kube-schduler by default is dumb, but you can make it smart
5. learn yaml
6. there is no gui, kubectl is enough
7. kubectl api-resources is your friend
